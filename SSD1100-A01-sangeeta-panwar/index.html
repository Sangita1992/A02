        I am immigrant here in Canada. I moved two years ago. I hold a degree in Bachelor of Technology which i earned in 2013. Thereafter, I worked as Admin Assistant for 8 years in government sector in India. </p>

        When I moved to Canada, I wanted to know about Canadian work culture so i joined as customer service representative in a salon and worked for a year. But, I always have passion for programming and wanted to work into IT field. However, I do have Bachelor Degree in Tech but experience. To follow my passion, I decided to join BCIT's <a href="https://www.bcit.ca/programs/software-systems-developer-certificate-full-time-7120cert/">SSD Program</a>. I hope this program help me to get entry in tech field.
