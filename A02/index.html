                When I moved to Canada, I wanted to know about Canadian work culture so i joined as customer service representative in a salon and worked for a year. But, I always have passion for programming and wanted to work into IT field. However, I do have Bachelor Degree in Tech but experience. To follow my passion, I decided to join BCIT's SSD Program. I hope this program help me to get entry in tech field.
